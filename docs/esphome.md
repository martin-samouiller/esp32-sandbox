Problem: MDNS not working on Home Assistant 

Check to ping the device on my mac:

```ping greenhouse1.local
```

Check to ping the device on the docker host (ubuntu server):

````
ping: greenhouse1.local: Temporary failure in name resolution
````

Installation of avahi-daemon on the docker host:
```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y avahi-utils
```

now on the docker host:
```
avahi-browse -a | grep greenhouse1
```
return 
```
eno1 IPv4 greenhouse1                                   _esphomelib._tcp     local
```
and 
```
ping greenhouse1.local
```
works

But still not working on Home Assistant.

![esphome home assistant error](assets/images/homeassistant/esphome-error.png)

Check to ping the device inside the docker container: 

```
docker exec -it homeassistant ping greenhouse1.local
```
return 

```
ping: bad address 'greenhouse1.local'
```

Go inside the docker container:

```
docker exec -it homeassistant bash
```

I'm able to ping the device using the ip address:

```
ping 192.168.1.XXX
```
but not using the hostname.


New docker-compose.yml file: (neee to add /run/dbus & )

```yaml
services:
  homeassistant:
    container_name: homeassistant
    image: "ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable"
    volumes:
      - ./homeassistant-data:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
    ports:
      - 8123:8123

```

The solution is to add /run/dbus to the docker-compose.yml file and change the network mode to host.

When I changed the network mode to host in HA, I had some issues with the Traefik configuration. 

**Bad Gateway**

I need to remove the traefik label config in the docker-compose.yml file and create a new ha-traefik.yaml file in the traefik/dynamic/ folder.
